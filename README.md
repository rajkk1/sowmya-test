Test repo to get used to some github commmands

Hello Sowmya! This small exercise will give you an idea of how we use Github to share code. What you'll do is take this "code" (i.e. just this Readme file), edit it, and merge it into the main repo. We will do this in several steps. For each step, I will give you the task and the command to run, but I'll let you figure out exactly how to use those commands (I think Google will be the easiest way!). So here we go!
